# app_v1
First version of an SLT memory app

This project is based on research in a 2018 paper on the benefits of training for speed and accuracy in word retrieval for post-stroke aphasia.

An initial prototype of this concept (just pages with no homepage) has been created and stored in this repo. 

The key features of the next version of the application would be:

1. A clean & clear interface with large buttons containing clear relevant symbols & text: for an example of a similar type of interface (and site) please look at aphasia therapy online.

2. The main feature of the app will be pages where a picture will display for 10 seconds before a beep sounds, the screen will go blank for one second and then the picture reappears with a written description over it. 

3. The home page (and others via a settings button) give you the ability to decrease the time as needed from 10 seconds to 8, 6, 4 etc.

4. The pictures must be pre-set and always appear in the same order.

Initially, plans did call for users to be able to upload their own pictures but on the basis of simplicity it has been decided to forgo this for now.

In terms of initial ideas and how to proceed I am keen to make this a JavaScript based project utilising the JAM stack as recommended.
